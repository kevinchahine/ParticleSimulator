# ParticleSimulator
A particle simulator based on gravitational, collision and electromagnetic forces. Implemented using high-performance computing in C++ using OpenCV as the linear algebra framework. Simulations are processed using very parallel matrix operations which take advantage of multi-threading and vector processing.
