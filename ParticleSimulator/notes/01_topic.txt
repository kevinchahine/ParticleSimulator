Particle simulator 

Goals:
	Performance		- 
	Capacity		- lots of particles (1M+)
	Extensibility	- 

Classes:
	- Particle
		- position (x, y)
		- velocity (x, y)
		- orientation (theta)
		- angular velocity (omega)
		- temperature
		- type

		Polymorphic???
			A particle for each element?
			Some particles can have customizable forces between them
			ex: A is attracted to B 
				B is attracted to A
				A is attracted to C
				C is repulsed by A
				B is repulsed by C
				C is repulsed by B
			ex:
				electron
				proton


	- Cloud
		container of particles
		need way to efficiently insert and remove
			order is never relevant

	- UI
		Show particles
			colors
				- particle type (element)
				- speed
				- temperature
			trails
				- speed trails
			ambiance
				- glow
			sparcles
				- for fusion

		bounding box
			fixed
			user controlled
			automatic
				single specific particle
					- trailed
					- locked
				cloud center of mass
		Show grid lines or markers

	- Factory
		Creates Particles and Clouds
	
	- Engine
		Forces (all these should be selectable without performance penalties)
			- Gravity
				gravitational constant
				distance
				mass

			- Electromagnetic
				electromagnetic constant
				distance
				charge
				attracts up close
				repelse when too close

			- Friction
				Speed
				Mass
				Constant

			- Temperature
				Force of Friction * distance increases temperature
				Temperature 

			- Fusion?????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
				When two particles get two close, they are replaced with 
				a different one. 
				And some energy is created somehow
				Maybe a new particle is respawned somewhere else but with
				very little energy.

			- Bounding Box
				What happens when particles leaves the simulation area?
					- Continues to move until position becomes inf
					- Is destroyed
					- Is destroyed and regenerated

			- Collisions?

			- External Forces (external to simulator)
				- weather taken from weather api can affect simulator
					- Temperature:
						decreases:
							increases electromagnetic constants
							friction coefficients
					- Humidity
						decreases:
							friction coefficients
					- Moon phase:
					- Tides:
					- Wind:
						
				- weather can be based on location
					must be optional (code should be able to run without it)
		Destroy some particles
		Regenerate destroyed particles
